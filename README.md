 ### Built With

This project was built with the following:
- <a href="https://cplusplus.com/">C++</a>.
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> for the IDE.

 ## About The Project
 
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/helenzina/Shop-Simulation/blob/main/screenshots/run.gif"  title="run"/>
</p>

The Shop Simulation project is a terminal-based application. The simulation mimics an online shop environment where users can place their order considering shipping fees, demonstrating the practical application of OOP concepts. This project marks a significant milestone as it represents the developer's first hands-on experience with Object-Oriented Programming principles. 

## Getting Started
 
 ### Installation
 
<p>Please follow the following steps for successful installation:</p>

1. **Clone the repo**.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/helenzina/Shop-Simulation
   ```

## Features

- **Item Management**: The application reads a text file containing a list of items available in the store which they can be modified as desired.
- **Order Modification**: Users can modify the quantity of each item they wish to purchase.
- **Item Code Validation**: Checks if the item code entered by the user exists in the items list and provides a message if it does not.
- **Order Processing**: Upon finalizing their order (by pressing the '0' key), users receive an output text file with their contact information, the complete order details, and the shipping fee of 20$, if the total is below 200$.

## How To Run

### Using Visual Studio Code

To run Shop Simulation, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder of your local repository in Visual Studio Code and make sure you have **C++** related and **Code Runner** extensions installed. 

2. Open the **Run and Debug** category and press the **Run** button.

### Using .exe

To run Shop Simulation, just run the already provided executable **Shop-Simulation.exe** and check the output in the **ORDERS.txt** file.


## Troubleshooting

**ONLY FOR THE FIRST RUN METHOD** <br>
This project was created using GCC C++ compiler (g++) and GDB debugger from mingw-w64. If you don't have any C++ compiler installed in your computer, follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMWD7wfhgNY">tutorial</a>.
